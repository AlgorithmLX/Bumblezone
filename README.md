<h2 style="color: #b76a00;"><strong>WHAT IS THE BUMBLEZONE?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The Bumblezone is a dimension filled with Honeycomb Blocks, Honey Blocks, Honey Crystals, Sugar Water, and few new bee-related Blocks! The dimension itself looks like it is the inside of a bee nest! You will find giant walls in rows with canals of water between them along with giant columns providing support to the ceiling all over. The walls and columns are riddled with honeycomb holes and if you look carefully, you may find hidden caves inside! By default, traveling a block in this dimension is the same as traveling 10 block in the Overworld. (A movement factor of 10. For reference, the Nether has a movement factor of 8 so traveling a block in the Nether is the same as traveling 8 blocks in Overworld). If you don't like this system, you can change the teleportation mode or movement factor in the configs! The other mode of teleportation available is leaving the dimension will always place you back at the exact spot you were at when you threw the Enderpearl to enter The Bumblezone! The's a third options that is a hybrid of these two teleportation modes so check out the config and read the description there for more info.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;But that isn't all! Within the dimension, bees are extremely protective of their honey. If you pick up a Honey Block, take honey from a Filled Porous Honeycomb block or Honeycomb Brood Block with a Glass Bottle, or you drink a Honey Bottle, all bees around you will get a speed, absorption, and strength potion effect and will become VERY angry at you! You will know you are in DEEP trouble when you get the Wrath of the Hive icon showing you got that effect and the fog in the dimension become more red! The bee will swarm you like crazy and will kill you unless you come very well prepared. A full set of unenchanted Diamond gear will not be enough but if you use a Bane of Arthropod V Diamond Sword, you might stand a chance. (but you can nerf the bees in the config if you find them too strong or buff them if you want to die!). And Bumblezone's experience can be enhanced when you have certain mods on such as Buzzier Bees, Potion of Bees, Beesourceful, or Productive Bees!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>1.16.2</strong></span></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>BLOCKS&nbsp;</strong>- 10 new blocks and 1 new liquid</span></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p><strong>&nbsp;Filled Porous Honeycomb Block</strong></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-Use Glass Bottle on this block to obtain a Honey Bottle and turn this block into a&nbsp;Porous Honeycomb Block. However, you will get a Wrath of the Hive effect if you do this. A Dispenser with a Glass Bottle can also pull honey out of this block and turn it into a regular&nbsp;Porous Honeycomb Block.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-You walk 10% slower on this block but barely noticable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Use a Silk Touch pickaxe to drop this block. Otherwise, mining it will drop a Honeycomb and a Porous Honeycomb Block.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Attaching a Comparator to this block will always output a redstone power of 1.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Porous Honeycomb Block</strong></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-Use a Honey Bottle on this block to turn this block into a Filled Porous Honeycomb Block.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-When mined, this block drops itself.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Honeycomb Brood Block</strong></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-Watch the larva inside grow through 4 stages over time! When at the 4th stage and this block gets ticked, it will spawn a Bee only if the hole in front isn't blocked off and there is less than 10 bees within 50 blocks of the block. After the bee is spawned, the block then resets back to having a stage 1 of the larva.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-The Larva grows much faster in The Bumblezone dimension but will still grow outside of it. You can speed up the larva stages by feeding it Honey Bottles which always results in growth or feed it Sugar Water Bottle which sometimes results in growth. You can use a Dispenser with Honey Bottles or Sugar Water Bottles right next to the block to automate the growing and spawning of bees with this block!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-If you use a Glass Bottle on this block, you will get a Honey Bottle, turn this block into an Empty Honeycomb Brood Block, and you will get Wrath of the Hive effect. A Dispenser with a Glass Bottle can also pull honey out of this block and turn it into an&nbsp;Empty Honeycomb Larva Block.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-When mined, this block drops&nbsp;Empty Honeycomb Brood Block and a Honeycomb and since you killed the larva, you get Wrath of the Hive effect as well. But if you use a Silk Touch pickaxe, you can get&nbsp;Honeycomb Brood Block instead without angering the bee or getting the effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Attaching a Comparator to this block will output Redstone power based on what stage the larva is in the block (1 to 4 power).</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Empty Honeycomb Brood Block</strong></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-Does nothing by itself. Merely a decorative block.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Honey Crystal</strong></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-A pretty translucent crystallized honey block that can face any direction and can only be placed on solid sides of blocks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-This block can be waterlogged but will transform any water liquid placed into it into Sugar Water instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Can be found underwater or in caves in The Bumblezone dimension. This is a non-renewable resource so treasure them! They are most common in Hive Wall biome and lest common in Sugar Water biome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-When mined, this block drops Honey Crystal Shards (works with Fortune enchantment). If you mine with Silk Touch, this block drops itself instead.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Sugar Water</strong></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-Looks like a lighter/cloudier version of regular water and spawns at sealevel for The Bumblezone dimension..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Entities swim slower in this liquid and the liquid will slowly heal any Bee touching it when the bee isn't taking any damage at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Sugar Cane placed on any block adjacent to Sugar Water will grow much faster and taller! The effect can be stacked up to 4 times (surround the block the Sugar Cane is on with 4 Sugar Water).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-When the flowing form of this liquid touches Lava,&nbsp;Sugar Infused Cobblestone will be made. If Lava touches the source block of Sugar Water,&nbsp;Sugar Infused Stone will be made instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Source blocks can be picked up and placed with a Bucket. Using Glass Bottles on this liquid will give you Sugar Water Bottle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Uses the water tag so that anything that checks for the water tag will work with Sugar Water. For example; keeping Coral alive or hydrating Farmland blocks. See this page for more details on what the water tagged blocks can do: <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tag#Fluids">https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tag#Fluids</a></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Sticky Honey Residue</strong></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-A very sticky block that can be placed on multiple solid surfaces at once and is created by smelting the following in a Furnace: Honey Crystal blocks, Honey Crystal Shards items, Honey Crystal Shields, or&nbsp;vanilla's Honey blocks. Breaking this block will drop nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-When any entity touches this block, they move extremely lowly. This block can also be climbed if it is on a wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-When activated, this block will power whatever block it is attached to and also power through that block as well like turning off a Redstone Torch on the other side. If Sticky Honey Residue is attached to the floor, it will power any adjacent blocks attached to it as well such as Redstone dust on the floor.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Sugar Infused Stone</strong></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-If placed in a Furnace, the sugar can be quickly burned off for some quick cheap XP.</p>

<p><strong>Sugar Water Bucket</strong></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-Obtained by using a Bucket on Sugar Water source block or crafting Water Bucket with Sugar. Can be used to move the water around.</p>

<p># # #</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;#&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Honey Crystal Shield</strong></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-A shield that starts off super weak but becomes much stronger the more you repair it to the point it has about double the durability of vanilla's Shield! But beware, trying to block fire damage and explosive damage with the shield will destroy the shield very quickly! Yes, Fireballs and Fireworks will also greatly damage the shield so be careful!<br /><br />-The shield can be repaired with Honey Crystal Shards and the recipe to craft the shield is the following with # being Honey Crystal Shards:<br /># # #</p>
<p># # #</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;#&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Any mob that physically hits your shield when you're blocking will apply a 4 second slowness effect on the mob due to the honey's stickiness!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-This shield can be enchanted with&nbsp;Unbreaking or Curse of the Vanishing. (Mending cannot be applied as that would make the shield way too overpowered at maximum durability)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Can be smelted in a Furnace to make 5 Sticky Honey Residue.</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>BEE'S BEHAVIOR </strong>-&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 14px;">NOT THE BEEEEESSSS!!!</span></p>

<div class="spoiler">
<p>-Contains only 3 biomes: Hive Wall Biome, Hive Pillar biome, and Sugar Water Floor Biome.&nbsp;Hive Wall Biome creates the flat walls of the dimension.&nbsp;Hive Pillar biome creates the large support columns that upholds the space.&nbsp;Sugar Water Floor takes up the rest of the space with low land and filled with Sugar Water.</p>

<p>Honey Crystal Shield</p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-A shield that starts off super weak but becomes much stronger the more you repair it to the point it has about double the durability of vanilla's Shield! But beware, trying to block fire damage and explosive damage with the shield will destroy the shield very quickly! Yes, Fireballs and Fireworks will also greatly damage the shield so be careful!<br /><br />-The shield can be repaired with Honey Crystal Shards and the recipe to craft the shield is the following with # being Honey Crystal Shards:<br /># # #</p>
<p># # #</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;#&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Any mob that physically hits your shield when you're blocking will apply a 4 second slowness effect on the mob due to the honey's stickiness!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-This shield can be enchanted with&nbsp;Unbreaking or Curse of the Vanishing. (Mending cannot be applied as that would make the shield way too overpowered at maximum durability)</p>

<h2 id="enter" style="color: #b76a00;"><strong>HOW DO I ENTER OR EXIT THIS WORLD?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Entering the dimension is super easy! Just throw an Enderpearl at any Bee Nest or Beehive (even modded ones works!) to enter inside it and spawn into the dimension. To teleport out of the dimension, you can either dig down and fall below <strong>Y = 0</strong> (don't worry, you won't die as I made sure of that) or climb your way to above <strong>Y = 256</strong>. The mod will see you are trying to leave and it'll take your coordinates in The Bumblezone dimension, convert it to the correct coordinate in the original dimension you came from and will try to place you near any Bee Nest or Beehive at that spot (or it'll create a new Bee Nest to place you next to if you does not find one already). Through normal use, you cannot use the mod to jump between dimensions but you can use it to travel long distances in any dimension you want. Just be sure to enter The Bumblezone from the dimension you want to fast travel in and then exiting The Bumblezone will put you back into that dimension.</span></p>

<h2 id="config" style="color: #b76a00;"><strong>HOW CAN I CONFIGURE THIS MOD?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach this mod's config file, go into the config file and find the Bumblezone config files. The config is applied to all worlds at once so keep that in mind!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;There are a TON of config options currently for the mod and all of them has comments on what they do and how to control them. I added lots of configs to control teleportation and gave you lots of options on how to tweak it. Several configs affects the dimension, how bright the fog is, and whether exiting the dimension will always place you back at Overworld instead of previous dimension you came from. There are even some worldgen options such as how rare the Bee Dungeons are. Some other configs lets you customize the Wrath of the Hive effect so you can change how long it lasts, how far bees has to be to be angered and boosted, how strong the effects given to bees are, whether Wrath of the Hive can be triggered outside The Bumblezone, show particles of the effect, or just turn off the effect completely. Lots of options including some that controls how some mods interacts with this mod! Take a look at the config and let me know if there's anything config that would be super helpful for you to have with this mod. :)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12px;">The ID for the dimension is <strong>the_bumblezone:the_bumblezone</strong> if you need it. Also, if you need the ID for any Bumblezone's block, item, or biome to add into other mod's configs files, check out the <a href="https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/Bumblezone/blob/master/src/main/resources/assets/the_bumblezone/lang/en_us.json">en_us.json file here</a> as the ID names of all the stuff is on there. For example, <strong><span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>block.the_bumblezone.porous_honeycomb_block<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span></strong>&nbsp;would be read as <strong>the_bumblezone:porous_honeycomb_block</strong> for the ID.&nbsp;</span></p>
