<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="color: #b76a00;"><strong>WHAT IS THE BUMBLEZONE?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;The Bumblezone is a dimension filled with Honeycomb Blocks, Honey Blocks, Sugar Water, and few new bee-related Blocks! The dimension itself looks like it is the inside of a bee nest! You will find giant walls in rows with canals of water between them along with giant columns providing support to the ceiling all over. The walls and columns are riddled with honeycomb holes. By default, traveling a block in this dimension is the same as traveling 10 block in the Overworld. (A movement factor of 10. For reference, the Nether has a movement factor of 8 so traveling a block in the Nether is the same as traveling 8 blocks in Overworld)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;But that isn't all! Within the dimension, bees are extremely protective of their honey. If you pick up a Honey Block, take honey from a Filled Porous Honeycomb block or Honeycomb Larva Block with a Glass Bottle, or you drink a Honey Bottle, all bees around you will get a speed, absorption, and strength potion effect and will become VERY angry at you! You will know you are in DEEP trouble when you get the Wrath of the Hive icon showing you got that effect and the fog in the dimension become more red! The bee will swarm you like crazy and will kill you unless you come very well prepared. A full set of unenchanted Diamond gear will not be enough but if you use a Bane of Arthropod V Diamond Sword, you might stand a chance. (but you can nerf the bees in the config if you find them too strong or buff them if you want to die!). And Bumblezone's experience can be enhanced when you have certain mods on such as Buzzier Bees, Potion of Bees, or Beesourceful!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">For more info on all the blocks and what mods Bumblezone has direct support for, just click each spoiler below!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>BLOCKS</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Filled Porous Honeycomb Block</span></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-Use Glass Bottle on this block to obtain a Honey Bottle and turn this block into a&nbsp;Porous Honeycomb Block. However, you will get a Wrath of the Hive effect if you do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-You walk 10% slower on this block but barely noticable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Use a Silk Touch pickaxe to drop this block. Otherwise, mining it will drop a Honeycomb and a Porous Honeycomb Block.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;Porous Honeycomb Block</span></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-Use a Honey Bottle on this block to turn this block into a Filled Porous Honeycomb Block.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-When mined, this block drops itself.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;Honeycomb Larva Block</span></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-Watch the larva inside grow through 4 stages over time! When at the 4th stage and this block gets ticked, it will spawn a Bee only if the hole in front isn't blocked off and there is less than 10 bees within 50 blocks of the block. After the bee is spawned, the block then resets back to having a stage 1 of the larva.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-The Larva grows much faster in The Bumblezone dimension but will still grow outside of it. You can speed up the larva stages by feeding it Honey Bottles which always results in growth or feed it Sugar Water Bottle which sometimes results in growth. You can use a Dispenser with Honey Bottles or Sugar Water Bottles right next to the block to automate the growing and spawning of bees with this block!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-If you use a Glass Bottle on this block, you will get a Honey Bottle, turn this block into a&nbsp;Dead Honeycomb Larva Block, and you will get Wrath of the Hive effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-When mined, this block drops&nbsp;Dead Honeycomb Larva Block and a Honeycomb and since you killed the larva, you get Wrath of the Hive effect as well. But if you use a Silk Touch pickaxe, you can get&nbsp;Honeycomb Larva Block instead without angering the bee or getting the effect.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;Dead Honeycomb Larva Block</span></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-Does nothing by itself. Merely a decorative block unless certain other mods are on. See the Mod Compatibility section below.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;Sugar Water</span></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-Looks like a lighter/cloudier version of regular water and spawns at sealevel for The Bumblezone dimension..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Entities swim slower in this liquid and the liquid will slowly heal any Bee touching it when the bee isn't taking any damage at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Sugar Cane placed on any block adjacent to Sugar Water will grow much faster and taller! The effect can be stacked up to 4 times (surround the block the Sugar Cane is on with 4 Sugar Water).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-When the flowing form of this liquid touches Lava,&nbsp;Sugar Infused Cobblestone will be made. If Lava touches the source block of Sugar Water,&nbsp;Sugar Infused Stone will be made instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Source blocks can be picked up and placed with a Bucket. Using Glass Bottles on this liquid will give you Sugar Water Bottle.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Sugar Infused Stone</span></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-If placed in a Furnace, the sugar can be quickly burned off for some quick cheap XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-When mined with a Silk Touch pickaxe, this block drops itself. Otherwise, <span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">this block drops Sugar and </span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Cobblestone.</span></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Sugar Infused Cobblestone</span></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-If placed in a Furnace, the sugar can be quickly burned off for some quick cheap XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-When mined with a Silk Touch pickaxe, this block drops itself. Otherwise, this block drops Sugar and Cobblestone.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>ITEMS</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Sugar Water Bottle</span></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-Obtainable by using a Glass Bottle on a Sugar Water source block.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Drinking this will give you half a bar of hunger and the Haste 1 effect for a short period of time. Sugar rush!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Can be fed to Honeycomb Larva Block by hand or Dispenser for a 30% chance of growing the larva.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Can be fed to any mob that extends BeeEntity to heal them slightly and spawn a heart particle. If fed to bees angry at you, there is a 7% chance of removing Wrath of the Hive effect off of yourself and escape a death of stingers!</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">Sugar Water Bucket</span></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-Obtained by using a Bucket on Sugar Water source block. Can be used to move the water around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Works with Dispensers too! The Dispenser can place the Sugar Water like any other buck of fluid.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>BEE'S BEHAVIOR</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">NOT THE BEEEEESSSS!!!</span></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-Any arthropod mob without "bee" in the name, any pandas, and any bears will get a weak version of Wrath of the Hive and nearby Bees will attack them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Any mob damaging a bee will get Wrath of the Hive effect and a bunch of angry bees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Picking up Honey Blocks, drinking a Honey Bottle, taking honey from a Filled Porous Honeycomb Block, or taking honey from a Honeycomb Larva Block will give you Wrath of the Hive effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Feeding angry bees a Sugar Water Bottle has a 7% of removing the Wrath of the Hive effect, heals the bee a bit, and calms nearby bees. Feeding the bee a Honey Bottle instead has a 30% chance of removing the effect and greatly heals the fed bee.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>DIMENSION</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">It's like the insides of a Bee Hive!</span></p>
<div class="spoiler">
<p>-Contains only 3 biomes: Hive Wall Biome, Hive Pillar biome, and Sugar Water Floor Biome.&nbsp;Hive Wall Biome creates the flat walls of the dimension.&nbsp;Hive Pillar biome creates the large support columns that upholds the space.&nbsp;Sugar Water Floor takes up the rest of the space with low land and filled with Sugar Water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Spawns Bees at a high rate and Slime mobs too. Will also spawn Spiders, Cave Spiders, Endermen, and Phantoms at a low rate (with Phantoms be rarest).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Walls in the dimension has Honeycomb Holes filled with Honey Blocks and has a few Honeycomb Larva Blocks. There is also a cave system inside the walls/pillars that are only exposed through the space that Honeycomb Holes creates.</p>

<h2 style="color: #b76a00;"><strong>HOW DO I ENTER THIS WORLD?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Entering the dimension is super easy! Just throw an Enderpearl at any Bee Nest or Beehive (even modded ones works!) to enter inside it and spawn into the dimension. To teleport out of the dimension, you can either dig down and fall below Y = 0 (don't worry, you won't die as I made sure of that) or climb your way to above Y = 256. The mod will see you are trying to leave and it'll take your coordinates in The Bumblezone, convert it to the correct coordinate in the original dimension you came from and will try to place you in that dimension near any Bee Nest or Beehive (or it'll create a new Bee Nest to place you next to if you does not find one already). Through normal use, you cannot use the mod to jump between dimensions but you can use it to travel long distances in any dimension you want. Just be sure to enter The Bumblezone from the dimension you want to fast travel in and then exiting The Bumblezone will put you back into that dimension.</span></p>

<h2 style="color: #b76a00;"><strong>HOW CAN I CONFIGURE THIS MOD?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;To reach this mod's config file, go into your world's save folder, open the serverconfig folder, and edit the the_bumblezone-server.toml file to change the config. The config is saved on a per-world basis so the configs in one world should not affect another world. <em>(Also, if you want to reuse the same config for future worlds, copy the config file and paste it in the defaultconfigs folder which is outside the world's save folders. Now future worlds will copy that config file and its settings into their own serverconfig folder!)&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;There are a TON of config options currently for the mod and all of them has comments on what they do and how to control them. Several configs affects the dimension and lets you control whether the dimension has a day/night cycle (that matches the Overworld's cycle), how bright the fog is, what the movement factor of the dimension is, and whether exiting the dimension will always place you back at Overworld instead of previous dimension you came from. Some other configs lets you customize the Wrath of the Hive effect so you can change how long it lasts, how far bees has to be to be angered and boosted, how strong the effects given to bees are, whether Wrath of the Hive can be triggered outside The Bumblezone, show particles of the effect, or just turn off the effect completely. Lots of options including some that controls how some mods interacts with this mod! Take a look at the config and let me know if there's anything config that would be super helpful for you to have with this mod. :)</span></p>
