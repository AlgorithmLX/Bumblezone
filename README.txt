    (V.0.0.1 Changes) (1.15.2 Minecraft)
    
	Major: 
·FIRST RELEASE OF THIS MOD

	Teleportation: 
·Throw an Enderpearl at a Bee Nest in any dimension to enter The Bumblezone dimension!
·To exit The Bumblezone dimension, go to Y = -1 or Y = 256 and it will place you back to the dimension you originally came from and if it can't resolve what dimension you came from, you'll be placed back in the Overworld. 
·Your XZ coordinates will be scale going to and from the dimension. In fact, traveling 1 block in The Bumblezone is the same as traveling 12 blocks in the Overworld!
·If you exit the dimension by going down through the floor, it will look for the lowest Bee Nest that is in the general area of your new scaled coordinates and will place you next to it. If no Bee Nest is found, it will place you on highest place and generate a Bee Nest at your feet.
·If you exit the dimension by going down through the ceiling, it will look for the highest Bee Nest that is in the general area of your new scaled coordinates and will place you next to it. If no Bee Nest is found, it will place you on highest place and generate a Bee Nest at your feet.

	Blocks: 
·Porous Honeycomb block is added

	Biomes: 
·Hive Wall biomes will be the giant flat vertical slabs filled with holes that the bees dug out. In each hole is some Honey Blocks! 
·Between the Hive Wall biomes is the Sugar Water Floor biome which creates a water filled space between each honeycomb wall. Bring a boat!

	Mobs: 
·Bees generate at a high rate in the dimension and will become aggressive towards Polar Bears and Pandas if the player somehow gets them into the dimension.
·If you pick up a Honey Block in the dimension, all bees that can see you within 64 range will become aggressive towards you. Beware, the bees will be REALLY angry and will have Strength 2, Absorption 1, and Speed 1!
·Spiders, Endermen, and Phantoms will spawn at a low rate with Phantoms being extremely rare.
·Slime will spawn at any height when a new chunk is created for the first time. However, they will only respawn in an already generate chunk if that chunk is marked as a "slime chunk" and at Y = 40 or below just like the Overworld.
